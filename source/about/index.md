My name is Ziqian ✧*｡٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و✧*｡

### Research Interest

I am interested in network data analysis and longitudinal data analysis. Most of my work in these fields can be found on my [github page](https://github.com/iasnobmatsu) and on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziqian-Xu-10). I would also love to learn more about data visualization and machine learning techniques. 

### Things I Enjoy

There are several things outside work that I really like.

- I like watching animes. My all-time favorite is Neon Genesis Evangelion. A recent one I watched is Dungeon Meshi. 
- Excercising is fun!
- Love music, expecially rock and roll music. "it's been a long time since i rock and rolled ~ "
- I play video games.
